Content: (A) No, turning left by 42 degrees would mean pointing your turning towards the upper right, not the lower left. Since the glass and metal tv stand is 8.5 feet from the camera, turning left by 42 degrees would not remove you from that position. Therefore, turning left by 42 degrees would still place the camera directly facing the TV, so you would not be facing away from the glass and metallic tv stand.

Content: (A) Incorrect, the direction of turning is not specified in the object description. Based on the coordinates provided, the plate is at point (0.170, 0.245). Without knowing the direction of the turn, it is impossible to determine if turning 50 degrees to the right would face you away from the plate.

Content: (A) In a 2D coordinate system, turning 90 degrees from the camera would shift the view as if moving forward towards the camera. Here, the direction you specified requires turning to the right, which actually aligns with moving to the right in 2D space. Therefore, turning 50 degrees to the right would not be a combined turn to the right and forward, which would move you away from the camera. The answer is no, since turning to the right in 2D would actually take you closer to the camera. However, the

Content: (A) No, you will not be facing away from black wooden oblique shelving unit (near the mark 4 in the image) because turning left by 33 degrees would position you towards the direction of the image, so you would still be facing the same direction. However, the exact direction depends on the distance and orientation of the objects relative to your viewpoint. Based on the given information, adjusting your position could change the viewpoint, but the question asks if turning left by 33 degrees would keep you aligned in that direction.
Solution: (A) no
------------- 16-20-18-36-759516 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) No, because the black wooden oblique shelving unit is in the upper left of the image, which is likely located in a direction opposite to turning left, so turning left by 33 degrees away from the shelving unit would not cause you to be facing away from it. The exact direction depends on the coordinate system, but typically in such contexts, turning left would increase the x and y coordinates. Wait, higher y is lower in image coordinates. Let me clarify. If the object is at (0.900.300) in the image, then the

Content: (A) No, because turning a 35 degree direction would not shift your position to the side of the sink so that you were facing away from it. The sink should remain in the same general direction as it was located in the original image. Since you are at point (0.807, 0.286), turning right slightly by 35 degrees would keep it in the same general position relative to your orientation, so no, you won not be facing away from the pedestal sink with a wide basin. Actually, you might be facing towards it because the direction is the same. Wait, but in a 3

Content: (A) Correct, turning left by 11 degrees will first face the left wall, which is where the window is located. However, the question mentions the matte red mark. Wait, the Objects Description says the 2D layout is designed to be viewed from the first camera position. The window is located on the left wall. But the requirement is about turning left by 11 degrees, which might face away from the window if looking from above or from the camera position. However, since the Objects Description allows for?
Solution: (A) yes

Content: (A) No. Since the point plate 0 is labeled 0.617 on the image, turning right by 50 degrees would mean facing the original direction, so you would be facing the original direction, not to plate 0.
Solution: (A) no
------------- 16-20-23-08-208151 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) Incorrect, turning right by 50 degrees would not necessarily face away from the target plate (near the mark 0) based on the provided spatial details. The question does not include information about the direction of the target plate or the movement direction, so we cannot definitively answer based on the given data. However, if the target plate is located in front of you and you move sideways to the right by 50 degrees without changing your forward direction, your facing angle

Content: The question is about turning right by 50 degrees from your current position. To determine if you will be facing away from Plate 0, we need to know your current facing direction. Since the scene description doesn not mention the orientation of the chairs or the plate, we cannot accurately determine if turning right by 50 degrees would change your facing. Therefore, the answer cannot be confirmed with the provided information.
Solution: (A) no

Content: (A) In the image, the plate is located at the center, bordered by five points. The turn brings you to the right, so turning right by 50 degrees would orient you towards the upper right direction. Since the plate is at the center, the direction would not change the field of view. Therefore, you will remain facing away from the plate.

Content: (A) No, the center point of  lowprofile brown wooden dresser (marked A) is not higher than black flat screen television (marked B). 3D scene has a coordinate system where the origin is at the top left corner. In such a coordinate system, the y coordinate increases downward. The y coordinates of the brown wooden dresser are less than 0.5, which is the same as the y coordinate of the black flat screen television. Since 0.5 is the vertical margin, the center point of the wooden dresser is below this coordinate,

Content: (A) Yes, the centerpoint of glass metal tv stand (highlighted by a blue box) at a higher height than gray colour sofa (highlighted by a green box) because the coordinates of the center are given as higher than the sofa. So the question is based on the spatial relationship between their positions relative to the viewer. The description states the TV stand is above the sofa, so its center is higher up in the frame. Since the x coordinate is higher and y coordinate is lower, the vertical center point is higher.

Content:  direction coordinate must be between 0 and 1. So, the new direction is less than 1. Since the original position is at coordinate 0.504, turning 33 degrees towards left would position you at 0.177, which is to the left of the original position. Therefore, you would be facing away from the black wooden oblique shelving unit (near the mark 4 in the image).

Content: (A) In standard image coordinate systems, the x axis increases to the right. The position of black wooden oblique shelving unit in the image is at point 4. The direction you turned is indicated by the 33 degree angle. To determine if you are facing away from the black wooden oblique shelving unit, we need to know your current and new relative positions. Since the shelving unit is at 4 in the image, but without knowing your exact path and coordinate system orientation, it is impossible to definitively answer. However, given
Solution: (A) no
------------- 16-20-23-08-231947 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) Incorrect, the current orientation is not specified in the Objects Description. However, since the black wooden oblique shelving unit is located at point (0.604, 0.020), turning left by 33 degrees would change the direction, so yes, turning left by 33 degrees would place you facing away from the black wooden oblique shelving unit 0. The answer is B.
Solution: (A) no
------------- 16-20-23-08-231947 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) Incorrect, the question does not provide information about the direction of the coordinates or the relative orientation, so we cannot determine if turning left by 33 degrees would face you away from the black wooden oblique shelving unit. The answer must be based solely on the spatial description provided. Since the coordinates of the objects are given and the horizontal axis ranges from 0 to 1, turning 33 degrees to the left would require knowing the y coordinate. However, the provided data only I

Solution: (A) no
------------- 16-20-23-08-231947 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) Incorrect, turning left by 33 degrees from face would not necessarily keep you facing away from the black wooden oblique shelving unit (near the mark 4 in the image) because the general direction of travel depends on the coordinate system used in the image. However, since the black wooden oblique shelving unit marks point 4, the direction from any point to its closest coordinate (4.000, 0.000) is along a point line and doesn not necessarily turn you away from the shelving unit. Without additional information about coordinate system orientation, it is impossible to definitively determine if.

Content: (A) No, turning right by 35 degrees would not face away from the pedestal sink with a wide basin because it is already angled downward to the far left near the viewer, meaning the sink isn not positioned directly in front. Moving right may not change the angle significantly if the direction aligns with the sink. However, without explicit information about the exact positions required for facing away, the answer is that turning right might not face away significantly unless aligned that way.

Content: (A) No, because you are initially facing the pedestal sink with a wide basin, which is the same direction as the point (4) in the image. Turning right by 35 degrees would shift your primary axis, potentially leading you away from the original position. But since the question asks if you will be facing away from the pedestal sink if you turn, the answer would depend on your initial positioning. The description mentions the sink has 3 marked at point (4), but no information about your current orientation allows
Solution: (A) no

Content: (A) No, because the sink is on the left side of the frame. If you turn right by 35 degrees, you would see the right side of the field of view, which might not align with the pedestal sink on the left. Wait, maybe I need to clarify the coordinate system. The image coordinate system might reference left as 1, right as 2, but I need to determine based on the objects description. The horizontal coordinate 0.264 is the right position. Since from the image coordinates, 0.264 would be 75 degrees from left. Therefore, turning 35 degrees...

Content: (A) Let me think. Since the Objects Description starts with mentions of the coordinate coordinates which places the objects in the room, this suggests that the Objects Description provided is based on the Scene description. Since the Objects Description mentions that the 2D location of Window (marked B) is not provided in terms based on the objects and mentions of their positions relative to the other, this also suggests that the description provided is based on spatial elements such as coordinates without additional such.

Content: (A) Indeed, the black square desk (near the mark 7 in the image) is positioned such that facing it from the point of view would require turning your back to it, so yes, you would be facing away from it when looking straight. 4.66 and it is located at position point (0.939, 0.900) so no, it is not behind. But since the viewer is facing the desk from the first perspective, the desk is behind the viewer. Since the viewer is facing the desk, the desk is not behind, so the viewer is not facing away from the desk. So the answer should

Content: (A) Correct. After turning right by 30 degrees, your gaze will be directed towards the desk and the individuals seated there as specified in the scene description, which corresponds to the direction facing away from the viewer. 140.00
Solution: (A) yes
------------- 16-20-24-01-141917 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) Yes. 30 degrees is less than 90 degrees. Since the image frame is a 1x1. 30 degrees is less than 90 degrees. So, turning right by 30 degrees and facing forward would mean facing directly at the camera, which is the front of the image. Since the image frame is a 1x1, the viewer would likely be facing forward. Wait, perhaps the question is about facing away from the viewer when turning left by the given angle. To turn left by 30 degrees would shift the body so the other side becomes.
Solution: (A) yes
------------- 16-20-24-01-141917 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) Yes. Since the chair is positioned at point (1.186, 0.514), turning right by 30 degrees would take you slightly off to the right of it, making you face away from the chair. Therefore, the answer is yes.

Solution: (A) yes
------------- 16-20-24-01-141917 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) Yes, because the image is viewed from the angle where the viewer faces the room, turning right by 30 degrees would align the new position with the space provided, meaning facing away from the chair.
Solution: (A) yes
------------- 16-20-24-01-141917 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) Indeed, turning right by 30 degrees would take you away from the chair without the mark 1, so the answer is no.
Solution: (A) yes
------------- 16-20-24-01-141917 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) Indeed, turning right by 30 degrees would position you directly facing away from the chair that is located at the same position as the chair mark in the image. Since the chair itself is at the center surrounded by the three people sitting at tables, turning right may require repositioning yourself, but based on perspective alone, turning right by 30 degrees would not necessarily orient you away from the chair. However, the scene description does not mention any objects blocking this direction change, so theoretically,

Content: (A) No, since the question is about facing away from the doorframe, and the doorframe is at the back of the image, turning left or right would not change your position relative to the door. However, the question provides information on a 36 degree turn, which is the angle of the turn. But based on the scene description, there are no other objects mentioned to control your facing direction beyond the door. Since moving around the door might be necessary, the correct answer based on given data is B. Yes.
Solution: (A) no
------------- 16-20-24-10-701801 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (B) Yes, since turning right at an angle of 36 degrees would change your facing direction, and the Doorframe is in the center of the image with coordinates (0.494, 0.058), turning right 36 degrees would position you facing away from it, as the Doorframe is likely positioned to your left. However, since the exact orientation isn
Solution: (A) no

Content: (C) Yes, you will be facing away from Doorframe (near the mark 1 in the image) when turning right by 36 degrees.
Solution: (A) no
------------- 16-20-24-10-701801 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) No, turning right by 36 degrees would place you facing towards the opposite direction of the first point marked by the red numbers, which in the image corresponds to the location of the door or structural support. Since the objects are mounted on the beige wall, facing away from them would still keep you near the central light and avoid the marked red numbers. However, the exact direction depends on the room layout, but based on the 1 on the staircase to the right, turning right would take you

Content: (A) In image 1, the viewer is facing forward, but in image 2, the viewer is facing away from the camera because the turn makes the viewer slightly face towards the direction of the other image, but the question is about turning right by 36 degrees relative to the camera face. Since the camera is facing forward, moving to the right by 36 degrees would position the face towards the left side of the image, not directly behind the camera or revealing the door. Therefore, the direction
Solution: (A) no
------------- 16-20-24-10-701801 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) No, turning right by 36 degrees would mean facing directly towards the door, which could be a different direction. Please check the image description to confirm the exact direction.
Solution: (A) no
------------- 16-20-24-10-701801 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) Incorrect, turning a 36 degree right direction from the image does not necessarily change the direction you are facing in reality Based on typical image coordinate systems where the origin is at the bottom left corner. In images, assuming standard 0.00 is top left. Since the image frame is already at the bottom left corner, moving right has a larger movement along the x axis. Turning left would require a decrease in x while turning right increases it. Without knowing the actual
Solution: (A) no
------------- 16-20-24-10-701801 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) no, which would require moving the camera backward, so you would actually be facing forward. Therefore, your direction relative to the door is directly towards the doorframe (near the mark 1), so yes, turning right by 36 degrees would move you away from the doorframe and facing forward. However, since the question asks whether this would require facing away from the door, the answer is no, you would be facing towards the doorframe and not away from it. But according to the objects description, the doorframe is 5.76 feet away,

Solution: (A) no
------------- 16-20-24-21-804057 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) In the image, the white glossy toilet and pedestal sink with a wide basin are positioned at the top center. However, the question is about facing away from the pedestal sink. Since the toilet is at the top center, if you turn right by 26 degrees from the toilet position, you would now be facing left, which would be towards the pedestal sink. Therefore, turning right by 26 degrees would indeed orient you away from the pedestal sink. So the answer is Yes.
Solution: (A) no
------------- 16-20-24-21-804057 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) No, the question is unclear. Let me check the reference. According to the rules, the answer must be based on the inputs and not provide any reveal of the Objects question. The reference provided does not specify any direction change. Therefore, the question cannot be answered with the given information. The answer should reflect that there is no directional change unless other details exist beyond what is described.  so the answer is that no, the user would not turn 26 degrees to face the pedestal sink.
Solution: (A) no
------------- 16-20-24-21-804057 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) Incorrect, turning right by 26 degrees from a straight path would face you towards the opposite direction of the pedestal sink with a wide basin, so you would indeed be facing away from it.
Solution: (A) no
------------- 16-20-24-21-804057 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) no, because the step is in front of the sink, so turning down will face away from the step, but since the sink is in front of the step, turn towards the step.
Solution: (A) no
------------- 16-20-24-21-804057 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) Incorrect, the distance between the camera and the pedestal sink with a wide basin and the turn right is 4.88 feet. Therefore, turning right by 26 degrees would require changing your position enough to pass behind the edge of the sink, but based on the provided information, the spatial details do not specify distance from the camera to the sink or the exact position of the turn. Without information about the sink placement relative to the camera or the edge of the turn, it is impossible to determine if this right turn
Solution: (A) no
------------- 16-20-24-21-804057 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) no, since turning right by 26 degrees would take you further away from the pedestal sink with a wide basin, so you would be facing away. Wait, the question says turn right by 26 degrees, so there might be confusion here. Let me check the scene description again. The scene shows the bathroom with the toilet and white countertop on the left. The marked point A is at 1. The pedestal sink is at center right, so moving right by 26 degrees would take you away from the sink. Hmm, maybe
Solution: (A) no
------------- 16-20-24-21-804057 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) In the image, the pedestal sink with a wide basin is part of the toilet setup. Since your turn would create an angle of obstruction towards the sink without significantly shifting your exact viewpoint, turning right by 26 degrees should keep you facing the toilet and away from the pedestal sink with a wide basin. Therefore, no direction, if it is a turn, would affect the facing direction of the pedestal sink with a wide basin. Thus, the answer is no, you will not be facing away from.

Content: (A) In the image, the Garbage can and the mark are 0.357 units apart. Since turning 360 degrees would face the opposite direction, turning 64 degrees away from the Garbage can would still be facing towards it. So the answer is no.
Solution: (A) no
------------- 16-20-24-21-821294 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) No, since the question is about facing GarbageCan (in the image) when turning right, and the point specified is about the right side of the area, so after turning right you would be facing the left side, away from the GarbageCan. Answer is B.

Solution: (A) no
------------- 16-20-24-21-821294 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) In image coordinate system, the x axis is to the right of the center and the y axis is downward. The coordinates of the GarbageCan are at point (0.634, 0.253). Since the image coordinate system has x going right and y going left, turning right by 64 degrees means turning right is to move left. Since the GarbageCan is at point (0.634, 0.253) in coordinates, turning left would align it with the observer. Therefore, turning right by 64 degrees means turning left. Hence, when approaching the GarbageCan from a direct vise
Solution: (A) no
------------- 16-20-24-21-821294 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------

Solution: (A) no
------------- 16-20-24-21-821294 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) no, it is not possible to turn right by 64 degrees and still face in the direction where the GarbageCan is located, since 64 degrees is closer to the left side of the image. The GarbageCan is located at the lower far left corner. Since you are moving right, your gaze would naturally face away from the GarbageCan. Therefore, the answer is no.

However, if you are facing left, as shown in the scene, the keychain would be to your right. Therefore, the answer is different based on your direction. To determine which side, you would need to reflect your position when facing 90 degrees. Since the keychain is near

Content: (A) Indeed, the television is positioned at point (0.930, 0.266), which means it is located above the mark 2 in the image. Since you are facing the wall, looking straight might not align with the television, so you would be facing away from the television. The answer is Yes.
Solution: (A) yes
------------- 16-20-26-13-760944 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) Correct, since the mirror is reflecting the scene, looking straight might mean your camera is positioned in a way that mirrors your view, but according to the mirror reflection in the image, the television at upper center is located at the upper center. Since the direction you mentioned is that the mirror is to the right, if the mirror is near the center, the TV is above you.
Solution: (A) yes
------------- 16-20-26-13-760944 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) Yes, the direction of the viewer is towards the point of (280.000, 0.014), so when standing near that point, you would be facing away from the television to the screen.  answer is Indeed.
Solution: (A) yes
------------- 16-20-26-13-760944 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) Correct, you are facing the direction opposite the TV, and since the television is off to the upper right, looking straight would place you facing away from it.
Solution: (A) yes
------------- 16-20-26-13-760944 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) Yes, you will be facing away from Television (near the mark 2 in the image) because the direction the light is coming from makes it hard to see past the wooden beam to the TV screen. Since the beam is in the wall it likely blocks the view from the front.  answer

Content: (C) The blue box coordinates are at point (0.724, 0.178). The silver rectangle trash bin with black top coordinates are at point (0.596, 0.511). Since the blue box is to the left of the trash bin, the blue box is on the left side of the trash bin, so gray sink is to the left of the green box. Therefore, gray colour sink is behind the silver rectangle trash bin with black top. 4.

Content: (A) Correct, 3D coordinate of point (0.371, 0.205) is 0.231 in, so the height is 0.231. 2.302 on the 2d coordinate table is 2.05 on the wall paint. So the distance from the wall paint at center to the window is 0.231m divided by the distance between the two objects. However, the question asks for the height, so 2.302 is the vertical difference from the center point to the window. If the window is at an unknown height, it can be observed. Since the window is at upper center, it is over the center point. To get the height,
Solution: (A) yes

Content: (A) Correct, the y coordinate of the center point of wall paint at a higher height than window is 0.541, which is farther from the viewer than the window, so the center point is indeed at a higher height. The answer is Yes.
Solution: (A) yes
------------- 16-20-26-25-616048 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) Indeed, wall paint at a is located at point (0.624, 0.189), which has a greater y coordinate than the window. Since the y coordinate measures height, this means the wall paint at a is higher up in the scene compared to the window. Therefore, the center point of wall paint at a is indeed higher than the window.

Content: (B) Incorrect, the height of the centerpoint of baseball bat with a cylindrical shape at a higher height than Doorway is not provided in the description. Therefore, I cannot determine its horizontal position relative to the other objects based on the given information. However, based on typical 3D perspective, the center of the frame is likely at eye height. Since the baseball bat is at coordinates (0.676, 0.602), and the main focus is the central area, it is plausible it is at a similar.

Content: (A) no, because turning by 34 degrees would still position you facing towards the glossy abstract painting with bold brushstrokes depending on your starting position, but without knowing your exact starting position, we can infer that if the painting is located in a direction consistent with the image, turning 34 degrees might shift your gaze away from it. However, since the image only specifies the direction of the painting relative to the image, we cannot determine if turning right by 34 degrees would be in an

Content: (A) Incorrect, the spatial relationship between the points provided does not indicate any obstruction blocking turning right by 34 degrees. However, the original scene description mentions the glossy abstract painting with bold brushstrokes is above the blue fabric couch on the left side of the frame. Since the painting is positioned above the couch, turning right might align the face away from it. Without explicit distance details provided, it is unclear if there is an obstruction, so the answer is not explicit. The question requires

Content: (B) Yes, turning right by 34 degrees would orient you away from the glossy abstract painting with bold brushstrokes located at point (0.854, 0.058).
Solution: (A) no
------------- 16-20-27-04-609130 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (B) Yes, because the glossy abstract painting with bold brushstrokes is located at the upper right of the image, so turning right by 34 degrees from the image would move you away from its image, meaning you are now facing away from it.
Solution: (A) no
------------- 16-20-27-04-609130 Accuracy reward: 0.0 -------------
Content: (A) Incorrect, the question contains an inconsistency because the description does not provide the coordinate or direction of the glossy abstract painting with bold brushstrokes. Therefore, it is impossible to determine if turning right by 34 degrees would face you away from it.
